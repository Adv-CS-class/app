# Advanced Computer Science App Team

List of things to do:
---------------
* Find suitable competition: https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/congressional-app-challenge-pa-07-rep-meehan/ (even though the app submission period has closed, we can still use the framework to shape our app development).

* Develop outline (see contents folder) and approach.

* Build app in Swift language.  

* Execute in Xcode and test.\

* Share code and collaborate via GitHub.

* Documentation/proof of concept.

* Video showing functions of the app (not longer than 4 mins).

* Submit video and documentation online (probably not needed now).
