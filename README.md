# App Team Outline (Latest update: 1/26/16)

Ideas
--------
* Optimization of someone's route. (Can use Google API and shortest distance optimization techniques)

* We could also do an optimization of Penncrest using the same basic idea, but we would need to map all the locations of our school (wings/rooms/gym/cafe/etc).  Dijkstra's Algorithm is straightforward optimization algorithm that we can fork and use in our project.

Resources
----------
* General problem that we will solve explained here.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_inspection_problem

* A possible solution is Dijkstra's Algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm.

* Another solution is the A* Heuristic Model: http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html (this may be easier to implement alongside API).

* Cool visualization here: http://kevanahlquist.com/osm_pathfinding/ followed by the source code on https://github.com/mplewis/osm-pathfinding.

* How to Code App Tutorial here: https://designthencode.com/scratch/ and https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1

Roles
------------
* Everyone should learn how to use Xcode and app design.

* Within the code, we should build files seperately. 

* Set up nodes for potential locations ("coordinates" for mapping out PHS).

List of things to do
---------------
* Find suitable competition: https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/congressional-app-challenge-pa-07-rep-meehan/ (even though the app submission period has closed, we can still use the framework to shape our app development).

* Build app in Swift language.  UI done in Xcode.  Source code/files built and shared via Github.

* Documentation/proof of concept.
