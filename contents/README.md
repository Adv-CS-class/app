# Outline (Latest update: 1/21/16)

Ideas
--------
* Optimization of someone's route? (Can use Google API and shortest distance optimization techniques)  Read here :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_inspection_problem

* We could also do an optimization of Penncrest using the same basic idea, but we would need to map all the locations of our school (wings/rooms/gym/cafe/etc).  Dijkstra method is straightforward optimization algorithm that we can fork and use in our project.

Roles
------------
* Everyone should learn how to use Xcode and app design. Tutorial here: https://designthencode.com/scratch/ and https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1
* Within the code, we should build files seperately. 
* Set up nodes for potential locations ("coordinates" for mapping out PHS).
